Problem Statement: Implement Word2vec from scratch.
1. Train a neural network to generate word embeddings in the form of
a weight matrix.
2. Embedding layers can be trained to generate custom embeddings
in popular neural network libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. You are free to train on large datasets such as Wikipedia.
4. Test the semantics, embedding vectors to see relationships such as
“king - man + woman = queen.”
